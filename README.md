This github link hosts material related to blockchain adoption, critical success factors, adoption metrics and scaling parameters. This landing page and the various drilldowns point to detailed 
content with respect enterprise blockchain adoption.

# Enterprise Blockchain Adoption Framework 

The enterprise blockchain adoption framework that serves as a reference to drive production adoption and scale. The base framework will be host precsriptive concepts for enterprise blockchain
transformation discovery, organizmational , and change menagement aspects of making enterprise blockchain applications mainstream.

Blockchain is a horizontal technollogy accross many verticals. The base framework with cover horizontal breadth aspects of the technology adoption as well as vertical depth aspects in various
verticals like payments, fintech, supply chain, trade, healthcare etc to facilitate cross-industry learning. Also, besed on specific nuances  the frameworks will be extended for specific 
verticals like healthcare, cross-border trade etc, to specifically call out technology, and other macro developments that are factors of adoption and scale. 

The intent of these frameworks is for the practitioners, developers and business devleopment to have a systemic reference framework to think about the blockchain technology, the
re-imagination of business processes it can drive, and the adoption factors and how to manage the management of this emerging technology for business results.

*Please note that in the early iterations of the framework content is likely to change between the base and the individual verticals, and is expected to be constantly refactoed for base 
versus specific verticals  as part of versioning , as the technology, standards, breakthroughs, and scaleable implementations mature rapidly at a horizontal level , and also as various
verticals start reporting high scale production deployments used at scale.

As the author and the industry practictioners report elements of scale and key success factros and results, including specific macro events that coudl function as catalyst the versions
will be constantly updated.
